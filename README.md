# AI-POWERED-SIGN-LANGUAGE-INTERPRETER
AI-powered sign language interpreters use artificial intelligence to automatically translate 
spoken language into sign language and vice versa, bridging communication gaps between 
deaf and hearing individuals. These systems leverage technologies like computer vision, 
natural language processing, and machine learning to recognize, interpret, and generate sign 
language gestures. This technology aims to enhance accessibility and inclusion for the deaf 
and hard-of-hearing communities by providing real-time translation and interpretation in 
various settings, including educational, social, and professional environments.   
This project presents an AI-powered Sign Language Interpreter â€” a real-time system that 
translates sign language gestures into spoken or written language using machine learning 
and computer vision technologies. The goal is to enable seamless communication between 
sign language users and non-signers, eliminating the need for a third-party interpreter and 
making everyday interactions more inclusive.   
The interpreter uses video input to detect and interpret hand movements, facial expressions, 
and body posture, which are essential components of sign language. Deep learning models, 
particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), 
are employed to analyze these visual cues and map them to corresponding words or phrases 
in the target language. The translated output is then delivered in a user-friendly format such 
as on-screen text or synthesized speech.   
This documentation outlines the technical foundation, system architecture, datasets used, 
training process, implementation details, and performance evaluation of the AI-powered 
interpreter. It also discusses the challenges faced in recognizing nuanced gestures and 
maintaining accuracy across different sign language dialects. By addressing these challenges, 
the project aims to contribute to the development of scalable, reliable assistive technologies 
that promote equal access to communication for everyone.
